<p>This is an archive of the activity of the Niagara, Ontario-based Shatter The Stigma Mend The Mind campaign. </p>

<p>The ultimate goal of the campaign was to help change the way people think about mental illness, eventually reducing the stigma that surrounds it and increasing the likelihood that individuals will get treatment. To achieve this, the campaign committee consisting 40+ members from various agencies in the Niagara community ran a number of campaigns and activities designed to steer people to a campaign website.</p>

<p>Pathstone Mental Health, the lead agency on the Campaign, identified the need to fight “stigma” during its strategic planning process in 2009, based on its desire to “increase awareness and decrease stigma related to mental illness”.  In the winter of 2011, Pathstone’s Board of Directors made a contribution to the Campaign, and in the spring of 2011, the Community Advisory Committee was formed. After shaping the committee, the Campaign focus was developed, the campaign slogan and logo were created, the specific Campaign components were discussed and the website was designed.</p>
